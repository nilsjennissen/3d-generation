# 🧭 Project Overview 

Version 1: 

Our team is excited to announce our participation in a 60-hour hackathon hosted by OpenAI. The project's primary objective is to leverage OpenAI's shap-e and gpt4all technologies to transform text into tangible 3D objects within the constrained timeframe.

Our innovative approach involves the use of recycled plastic filament as the raw material for the production of these objects, thereby promoting sustainability. The 3D printing process will be executed on self-assembled 3D printers, further demonstrating our commitment to resourcefulness and efficiency.

The potential business implications of this project are vast. We envision a future where individualized furniture items, everyday objects, and even fashion items can be printed on-demand using sustainable materials. This project not only represents a technological breakthrough but also a significant stride towards a more sustainable and personalized consumer market.

Introduction

Welcome to our project! We are a team of passionate developers and tech enthusiasts participating in a 60-hour hackathon hosted by OpenAI. Our project aims to leverage OpenAI's shap-e and gpt4all technologies to transform text into tangible 3D objects. We are using recycled plastic filament as the raw material for the production of these objects, promoting sustainability and resourcefulness. 

# 🚧 Prerequisites

To get started with this project, you will need:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI's shap-e and gpt4all libraries
- 3D printer with the capability to use recycled plastic filament
- Basic knowledge of 3D printing and AI technologies

# 🎛 Project Setup

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your 3D printer according to the manufacturer's instructions
4. Run the main script using `python main.py`

# 📦 Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the project
- `requirements.txt`: Contains all the Python libraries required for the project
- `data/`: Directory containing the data used for the project
- `models/`: Directory containing the trained models
- `utils/`: Directory containing utility scripts

# 🗄️ Data

The data used for this project consists of text descriptions of various objects. These descriptions are transformed into 3D objects using OpenAI's shap-e and gpt4all technologies.
